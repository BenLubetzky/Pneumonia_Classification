Pneumonia Classification project

An image classification project on pneumonia, done on kaggle. I really like applying 
AI and specifically image processing on medical stuff and I think this one is really useful too.
89% accuracy on the model which is very good.

Tech used: numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib and sklearn

Extra stuff:

I really enjoyed working on this project, I especially liked using generators to make things
more efficient and higher level, the tuning of the model was really fun too.

Hope you liked it!
